## ðŸ”­ My Featured Project

### [A Machine Learning Exploration of Movie Success Factors](https://github.com/AmbrishMuniraju/Movie-Success-Factor-Analysis)
This was my MSc dissertation project, where I used Python, XGBoost, and Scikit-learn to analyze and predict the success factors of movies based on IMDb data. The project involved the full data science lifecycle, from data cleaning and feature engineering to model tuning and evaluation, achieving an R-squared of 0.91.
